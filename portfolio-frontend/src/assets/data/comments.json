The work you accomplished is highly satisfactory and could easily be integrated into the Bank’s IT architecture. \nI would like to personally thank you for your human and professional qualities. In the corporate world, it is essential to rely not only on proven professional skills, but also on generosity and respect in the workplace. You were able to combine all of these qualities, which allowed you to integrate the SSD team smoothly. Your parents should also be thanked for the education they gave you. \nI wish you the very best moving forward, Mr. FALL. May the Almighty guide your path and grant you wonderful professional opportunities. Ameen! \n\nKind regards",
